--------------------------------
The Goal of the game is to beat the Dealer with either a 21 count or higher sum card number.
There could be multiple decks in this game, so don't be startled with repeating cards.
If you go over the sum of 21 you bust, and automatically lose the bet you put in.
If you beat the dealer you will win the bet x<multiplier>
Conversely: You lose the round you lose the x<multiplier> bet
Once cards are dealt, you are given the option of either H: Hit or S: Stay
If you choose to Hit you are given another card until you either reach 21, stay, or Bust
If you Stay, round ends dealer flips his card.
If you bust, you automatically lose the round.
If you go even with the Dealer no money is gained nor lost.
Value of 10->King is 10, Value of Ace is 11L: until value of hand is greater than 21, then it turns into 1
